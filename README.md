# Digital Quantum Simulation

## Overview

Digital quantum simulation is an algorithm which a quantum computer may use to simulate the time evolution of real-world, quantum systems. A specific example of where this might be useful is for the task of simulating the behavior of complex molecules. To perform this task, we must first write down the Hamiltonian (a matrix describing the allowed states of the system) corresponding to a particular molecule. Then, we can generate a quantum program using this Hamiltonian which a quantum computer will execute to simulate the molecule's time evolution. We also call this task "Hamiltonian simulation" and the process of compiling these quantum programs is the subject of this repository and the paper *Optimized Program Execution Ordering to Mitigate Errors in Simulations of Quantum Systems* which was published in the 2021 International Conference on Rebooting Computing.

The `dqs` module contains the code used to compile Hamiltonian simulation circuits with the *max-commute-tsp* and other term-ordering strategies. The main `Dynamics` class is defined within `dqs/quantum_dynamics.py` and it can be constructed by passing in one of the molecular Hamiltonians found within `dqs/hamiltonians`. Once the `Dynamics` instance is constructed, the terms within the Hamiltonian can be sorted using a number of different compilation strategies in the `Dynamics.sort_hamiltonian()` function, and the corresponding quantum circuit can be generated by calling `Dynamics.gen_circuit()`.

## Installation
First create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv your_virtual_env
source your_virtual_env/bin/activate
```

Then clone and install the `dqs` package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/teaguetomesh/dqs-term-grouping.git
cd dqs-term-grouping
pip install -e .
```
